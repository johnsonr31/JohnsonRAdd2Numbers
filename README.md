This program will take user inputs for two numbers, and then add them together. It will also ask them if they want to add two numbers in the first place, and will give them the option to quit and end the program if they choose to

Peer Review: Arely Martinez - The program does what it was asked. It used both data validation for the number and if the user wants to replay. I liked the comments like 'restarting...' and 'Calculating..' it made it very easy to understand what was going on. I thought it was out of place if I didnt enter in a whole number for the first or secound number, it would redirect me to the start of the program rather than just ask me to enter in a vaild input instead ( this is just a very small consideration that would make it easier for the user).
